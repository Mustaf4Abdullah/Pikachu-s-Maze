Pikachu's Maze Navigation Project
This project simulates Pikachu navigating a maze to reach Ash, using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The maze is represented as a graph structure, and Pikachu's movements are influenced by energy gains and losses at specific points in the maze.

Key Features
Maze Navigation: Pikachu starts with 50 energy points and must reach the exit without running out of energy.
Dynamic Energy Updates: Certain points in the maze add or subtract energy.
Pathfinding: Implements efficient navigation through the maze with detailed path tracking.
Restart Mechanism: If Pikachu runs out of energy before reaching the exit, the game restarts with updated paths.
